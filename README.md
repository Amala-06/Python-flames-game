# Python-flames-game
The term FLAMES stands for Friends, Lovers, Affectionate, Marriage, Enemies, and Sibling. Although the outcome of this game cannot be used to determine if a person is suited for you, playing it with friends may be entertaining.

In this game, there are two phases:

Consider the two names.
Eliminate the recurring characters and their associated occurrences.
Find out how many characters are still available.
Consider the letters FLAMES as ["F", "L", "A", "M", "E", "S"].
Using the count we obtained, begin eliminating letters.
The outcome is the last letter of the procedure.
